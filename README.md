openpprn-app
============

This is the front-end programming prototype for the OpenPPRN.
While it serves as a prototype, this is written in haml and sass, using bootstrap, and so could be eventual production code.

This codebase should remain as a static prototype site, so that changes to the front-end can be demonstrated quickly without fear of messing up the functionality of the production application. This approach also keeps the prototype simple, and without the burdens of dealing with integrating with model/controller code.

This code is using the Middleman framework (http://middlemanapp.com/). Middleman is a static website generator, and in this configuration is using haml, and sass, and layouts to generate a prototype of the production OpenPPRN app.

The main contributor to this codebase is Sean Ahrens.
